 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.078   TIME= 13:00:55
 Using 1 iteration per substep may result in unconverged solutions for   
 nonlinear analysis and the program may not indicate divergence in this  
 case.  Check your results.                                              

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.109   TIME= 13:00:55
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.141   TIME= 13:00:55
 SOLID186 wedges are recommended only in regions of relatively low       
 stress gradients.

 Material number 7 (used by element 4533 ) should normally have at least 
 one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of energy by  
 material may not be available.                                          

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       3.312   TIME= 13:00:56
